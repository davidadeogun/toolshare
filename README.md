# Introduction 
Welcome to Tools Share, a community-driven platform built with Next.js, designed to enable members within the same community to rent and borrow tools from one another. Our mission is to promote sustainability and community spirit by providing a platform where users can share tools instead of purchasing new ones. Whether you're looking to borrow a drill for a quick DIY project or you have gardening tools gathering dust in your shed, Tools Share connects you with your neighbors to share resources efficiently.
